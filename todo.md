- To show the performance of the LHGCE see the strongest predictions for the drugs and see whether the diseases are actually associated with them or not in the main dataset website. Just like what LAGCN has done.
- Check whether the drug-diseases association that LAGCN has predicted are presented on the dataset or LAGCN has done something unordinary?

- trim the codebase, remove the unnecessary functions/directories and also clean the results
