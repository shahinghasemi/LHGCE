| condition | acc | auc |
|-----------|-----|-----|
|for encoders, train interactions are only used, for DNN trained interactions and all the nonInteractions   | 0.037 | 0.5 |
| used an equal division of interactions and nonInteractions in encoder and DNN, what was weird is the acc is the same in all folds!!| 0.885 | 0.48 |
